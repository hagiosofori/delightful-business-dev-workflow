Delightful Business development workflow


- Prototype (ideally, high fidelity). Just the core concept.
	- test prototype with focus groups / potential users. Refine prototype based on feedback, and seek their feedback again, until you reach a delightful place.
	- focus group size should not be less than 30 people.

- MVP. Actual product that people can start using. Focused on just the most important features that they’ll need. None of the non-essentials. The most important user flow(s).
	- push this to the market, and get their response. Refine based on the market’s response.
	- to test product-market fit.
	- test user size should not be less than 30 people.

- proof of concept (to test that the business model works, and the tech can do what its supposed to, at scale)

- refine & scale up

- identify the risk factors that could negatively impact business, and diversify the business / build in buffers and safety nets that will keep the business afloat if these risk factors ever become reality.
   - store up sufficient levels of cash. as much as possible, don't let it impact growth.
   - offer alternative products/services that align with the business, but can generate cash if these risk factors become real.
